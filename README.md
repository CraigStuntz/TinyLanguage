# Tiny Language

This is sample code for a talk I have given at various conferences, called 
"Programs that Write Programs: How Compilers Work"

The [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/craigstuntz/programs-that-write-programs-how-compilers-work)
are online.

## Getting Started

Restore packages with [Paket](https://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/index.html):

```
PS TinyLanguage> .\.paket\paket.exe install
```

Then run the NUnit tests however you like to. I use the 
[Visual Studio NUnit 3 Test Adapter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NUnitDevelopers.NUnit3TestAdapter).
